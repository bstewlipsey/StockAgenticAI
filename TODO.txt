## Agentic Stock AI - Final Validation & Readiness Checklist (Context-Aware)

This checklist rigorously verifies all critical components, ensuring reliable operation and confirming readiness for automated, agentic trading. It's tailored to your current `config.py` and README, particularly focusing on the `TEST_MODE_ENABLED` setting.

---

## === PROGRESS REPORT (as of 2025-05-27) ===

**Extensive Completion Report:**

- All core and auxiliary test files (`test_core.py`, `test_asset_screener_bot.py`, `test_decision_maker_bot.py`, etc.) have been updated and now fully reflect the latest features, bug fixes, and integration requirements. All tests pass, with only minor warnings about test return values (no functional errors).
- AssetScreenerBot fallback logic is robust and always returns at least one valid crypto asset, as verified by dedicated tests. Edge cases (empty/invalid screening results) are handled gracefully.
- DecisionMakerBot output structure is now fully consistent, with `final_action` and `signal` fields always present and correct. All downstream consumers (PositionSizerBot, RiskManagerBot, TradeExecutorBot) are compatible.
- All `.format()` string formatting for prompt construction has been refactored to use f-strings or safe variable replacement, eliminating runtime prompt errors and ensuring compatibility with all prompt templates.
- Alpaca Bar attribute usage is now correct and consistent throughout the codebase. For stocks, only the correct Alpaca attributes (`bar.t`, `bar.o`, `bar.h`, `bar.l`, `bar.c`, `bar.v`) are used. For crypto, the correct attributes are used as well. All timestamp warnings and attribute errors have been resolved.
- AssetAnalysisInput and all dataclass signatures/usages are now consistent across the codebase and all tests, preventing signature mismatch errors.
- RiskManager now correctly calculates and returns `unrealized_pnl` and `unrealized_pnl_pct` for both positions and portfolios. All risk metrics are available for downstream logic and tests.
- ReflectionBot persistence and learning integration is confirmed. Reflection insights are generated, stored, and persist across restarts. Visualizer and log checks confirm correct operation.
- Logging is ASCII-safe and robust, with no Unicode or encoding errors, even on Windows. All logs are clear and readable.
- Short-term system validation (4.4) is complete: `main.py` runs in `TEST_MODE_ENABLED`, all features are exercised, no errors or warnings in logs, fallback logic and risk metrics are verified, and the system is ready for extended testing.
- All configuration is centralized in `config.py` and `config_trading.py`, and all shared data structures are in `data_structures.py`, as required by project standards.

**Resolved Errors and Issues:**

- `.format()` prompt construction errors (replaced with f-strings/safe formatting)
- Alpaca Bar attribute errors (incorrect/missing attributes, especially `timestamp`)
- AssetScreenerBot fallback logic failures (now always returns a crypto asset)
- DecisionMakerBot output structure/signature mismatches
- Dataclass signature mismatches (especially AssetAnalysisInput)
- RiskManager missing or incorrect `unrealized_pnl` calculation
- Logging UnicodeEncodeError and display issues
- Test failures due to inconsistent test data or API/attribute mismatches
- ReflectionBot persistence and learning integration bugs

**Suggestions for Next Steps:**

1. **Extended Paper Trading/Simulation (4.5):**
   - Set `TEST_MODE_ENABLED = False` in `config.py` and adjust `TRADING_CYCLE_INTERVAL` to a realistic value (e.g., 60 seconds or more).
   - Expand `TRADING_ASSETS` in `config_trading.py` to your desired long-term portfolio.
   - Run the system in a paper trading or simulation environment for several days to weeks, monitoring for any new issues, performance trends, and learning outcomes.
   - Use `bot_visualizer.py` to monitor performance, reflection insights, and log events in real time.

2. **Continuous Performance Monitoring and Reflection Loop (4.6):**
   - Ensure ReflectionBot is scheduled to run periodically (daily/weekly) to analyze TradeOutcome data and generate new insights.
   - Establish a process for reviewing and acting on ReflectionBot's insights, including adjusting strategy parameters or prompt templates as needed.

3. **Prepare for Live Trading (4.7):**
   - Only after extended paper trading is successful and stable, set `ENABLE_TRADING_BOT = True` in `config.py`.
   - Closely monitor live trades and system behavior, especially during the initial live phase.

4. **Documentation and Maintenance:**
   - Update the README and any internal documentation to reflect the current system state, test procedures, and operational guidelines.
   - Consider automating test runs and log monitoring for ongoing reliability.

5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Explore additional asset types, new data sources, or advanced AI prompt strategies.
   - Implement more granular error handling and alerting for production readiness.
   - Continue to expand test coverage as new features are added.

**Anything Else to Add:**
- All strict requirements at the end of this file are being met: configuration, data structures, file naming/location, and test organization.
- The system is now in a robust, maintainable state and ready for long-term validation and future enhancements.
- If any new errors or warnings appear during extended testing, add them to this TODO and address them promptly.

## === NEXT ACTIONS CHECKLIST ===

- [ ] Set `TEST_MODE_ENABLED = False` in `config.py` for extended simulation.
- [ ] Adjust `TRADING_CYCLE_INTERVAL` in `config.py` to a realistic value (e.g., 60 seconds or more).
- [ ] Expand `TRADING_ASSETS` in `config_trading.py` to your desired long-term portfolio.
- [ ] Run the system in paper trading/simulation mode for several days to weeks.
- [ ] Monitor logs and use `bot_visualizer.py` to track performance, reflection insights, and errors in real time.
- [ ] Ensure ReflectionBot is scheduled to run periodically and that its insights are reviewed and acted upon.
- [ ] Update README and documentation to reflect the current system state and operational procedures.
- [ ] Consider automating test runs and log monitoring for ongoing reliability.
- [ ] If/when stable, set `ENABLE_TRADING_BOT = True` in `config.py` to enable live trading (after all other steps are complete).
- [ ] Add any new errors, warnings, or improvement ideas to this TODO as they arise during extended testing.

# --- STRICT REQUIREMENTS (DO NOT REMOVE) ---
- All configuration must be in `config.py` (system/API) and `config_trading.py` (strategy/bot). create new configuration file if needed
- All shared data structures must be in `data_structures.py`.
- All bot files must remain in the project root and follow the naming convention `bot_<purpose>.py`.
- All new configuration or data structure files must be placed in the project root.
- All test files must be named `test_*.py` and placed in the project root.
- Do not move or rename existing files unless explicitly required.
